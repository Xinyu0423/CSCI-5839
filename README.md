# CSCI-5839

## Semester Took this Course
Fall 2021

## Grade
A

## Note for This Class
1. This class may be a bit strange as a CS class. It does not have a lot of programming content, but teaches a lot of knowledge about designing computer software/APP. If you are interested in this part, then this class will be very suitable for you.
2. There will be an in class exercise in each class of this class, so try not to be absent. But because there is not a lot of programming content in this class, this class is generally relatively simple

5. The predecessors planted trees, and the later generations enjoyed the shade. I also got a lot of inspiration from other people's repo in the process of learning, so I uploaded my course material, I hope these content will help you.
